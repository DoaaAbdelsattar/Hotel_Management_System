# 🏨 Hotel Management System Database Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Hotel Management System** developed as part of a **Database Systems course**.
It focuses on designing and implementing a relational database that supports hotel operations such as
guest management, room booking, staff shifts, and payments.

The project covers:
- ERD & Relational Mapping
- SQL Implementation (DDL, DML, Queries)
- GUI connected to the database
- Complete documentation

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design an ER/EER diagram with entities, attributes, and relationships
- Map the ERD into a relational schema
- Implement the database using SQL Server
- Execute queries to demonstrate functionality
- Build a GUI connected to the database
